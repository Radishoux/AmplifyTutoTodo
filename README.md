# AmplifyTutoTodo
This tutorial guides you through setting up a backend and integrating that backend with your React app. You will create a “Todo app” with a GraphQL API and to store and retrieve items in a cloud database. In addition, we’ll demonstrate how to authenticate users, communicate with our API, and set up continuous deployment and hosting.


Getting started
The open-source Amplify Framework provides the following products to build fullstack iOS, Android, Flutter, Web, and React Native apps:

Amplify CLI - Configure all the services needed to power your backend through a simple command line interface.
Amplify Libraries - Use case-centric client libraries to integrate your app code with a backend using declarative interfaces.
Amplify UI Components - UI libraries for React, React Native, Angular, Ionic and Vue.
The Amplify Console is an AWS service that provides a git-based workflow for continuous deployment & hosting of fullstack web apps. Cloud resources created by the Amplify CLI are also visible in the Amplify Console.

GraphQL is a data language that was developed to enable apps to fetch data from APIs. It has a declarative, self-documenting style. In a GraphQL operation, the client specifies how to structure the data when it is returned by the server. This makes it possible for the client to query only for the data it needs, in the format that it needs it in.
